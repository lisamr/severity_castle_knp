# Landscape Fire Severity Analysis

## Project ideas

1.  What are the drivers of fire severity in KNP + Castle fires?
2.  Does controlling for fire direction change these drivers?
3.  How does the effect of forest structure and mortality decay with distance? How does it interact with weather (question below)?
4.  Under what weather thresholds does forest structure and mortality not matter?

## Approach

-   Gather all the relevant predictors and response variables as raster layers
-   Response:
    -   [x] fire severity. Use ML-derived metric of CBI using the Parks et al. 2019 code.
-   Possible predictors:
    -   Fire history
        -   [x] severity of last fire,
        -   [x] years since last fire.
        -   For severity---take the FRAP polygons, flatten fires, group by year into multipolygons. You'll have \~35 features, 1 for each year from 1984-2021. Use that for the GEE code (Parks et al. 2019), which won't have to be modified.
    -   topography
        -   [x] elevation
        -   [x] TPI -- need to buffer dem by 1000m since your window goes up to that.
        -   [x] HLI
        -   [x] slope
        -   [x] aspect
        -   [x] add hillshade for viz
    -   daily fire progression perimeters
        -   [x] from IR flights
        -   [ ] MODIS? to fill in missing days?
    -   [x] Fire direction---heading, backing, flanking informed by aspect, slope, direction of nearest fire progression perimeter
    -   [x] Forest structure--density, CHM where available? SD of NDVI might work eg. Koontz EcoLett 2020?.
        -   [x] added NDVI, should be good enough. used composited landsat imagery year of fire
            -   [x] make a wider buffer around fire when exporting. 5km?
    -   forest mortality
        -   [ ] Yan's model--based on 2020 NAIP
        -   [ ] eDart in the meantime--cumulative mortality from 2015-2020?
    -   weather
        -   [ ] RH
            -   [x] From Koontz EcoLet 2020: We calculated pre-fire fuel moisture as the median 100-h fuel moisture for the 3days prior to the fire using gridMET, a gridded meteorological product with a daily temporal resolution and a 4Ã—4km spatial resolution (Abatzoglou [**2013**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.13447#ele13447-bib-0001)). The 100-hour fuel moisture is a correlate of the regional temperature and moisture which integrates the relative humidity, the length of day, and the amount of precipitation in the previous 24h. Thus, this measure is sensitive to multiple hot dry days across the 4x4km spatial extent of each grid cell, but not to diurnal variation in relative humidity nor to extreme weather events during a fire.
        -   [ ] wind
        -   [ ] inversions?
-   [x] Stack these rasters---same crs, resolution, extent
-   Model the data
    -   Bayesian regression model using a distance-weighted coefficient for landscape mortality. Use \~25% of data, randomly selected, account for SA with NNGP.
    -   Run a ML model using the same predictors as above, except there's no functional structure to it.

## Repo notes

I didn't upload most of the spatial datasets bc of space. check out gitignore for that.

## Methods notes

### Fire severity data

I used Parks et al (2019) to derive CBI from landsat imagery. That's gonna be my response variable. I also used that code to get the severity of the last fire under the KNP and Castle fire footprints.

-   [x] About that: the default dates are 6/1 to 9/30. creek fire started 8/26. double check that the pre-fire imagery is for the previous year, not the same year as fire.

### IR data

I downloaded IR data from <https://ftp.wildfire.gov/public/incident_specific_data/calif_s/> for the KNP and SQF fires. SQF included Castle, Shotgun and halfway through, the Rattlesnake fire. I clipped it to just include Castle fire since that's the only one I have complete data for.

I downloaded the data directly from the website using the package RCurl. The data wasn't clean and it varied whether it was exported as a shapefile, kmz, or gdb file. The shapefiles for both fires had the fewest mistakes. General steps were the following:

Download data for each day. Assume flights were taken around midnight of that date.

-   Turn into an sf object
-   Bind rows for each fire
-   Group by day (derived from createDate or filename), union so you have one multipolygon per day
-   Clip fires to castle and knp perimeters from FRAP
-   I used the FRAP perimeters for getting fire severity from GEE
-   If there were any geometrycollections, pull out just the polygons. GCs don't play nice with geometry functions.
-   Ensure that the previous day of fire was nested within that day's fire. Did this by unioning the geometry of polygon[t] with polygon[t-1] in a for-loop. Had to remove any linestrings that were created in the loop, keeping only polygons.
-   Save both versions of the data: IR polygons with and without unioning (e.g. castle_byDay.geojson, castle_byDay_u.geojson)
